    <h1>Garlic Butter Crispy Potatoes Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/crispy-potatoes.jpg" alt="" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="text">
      These potatoes taste exactly like garlic bread but in potato form. They
      are buttery, have subtle notes of garlic and are crispy and crunchy on the
      outside while fluffy on the inside. These smashed potatoes are the
      absolute best and crispiest.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="text">
      <li>1.5kg baby white potatoes</li>
      <li>1 head garlic</li>
      <li>100g Westgold salted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper (to taste)</li>
      <li>parsley (finely diced, to serve)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="text">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius.</li>
      <li>
        Cut the top off the head of the garlic and place into a small oven proof
        pot with a lid or into a sheet of foil. Drizzle with olive oil and
        season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cover and bake for 1 hour. Allow
        to slightly cool and squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skin. Set to
        the side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with heavily salted cold
        water. On a high heat, cook for 30 - 40 minutes or until they are tender
        enough for a skewer to be poked through the middle. Start your timer as
        soon as you place the potatoes onto the stove and not when the water is
        brought to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the potatoes into a colander and place into the fridge to allow
        for all the moisture to evaporate. Alternatively, you can pat them dry
        with a paper towel but it is extremely important they are dry and there
        is no remaining moisture.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a deep dish tray on a low heat, combine the butter and olive oil and
        cook until melted. Add the roasted garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper
        and cook for 2 minutes or until all are well combined. Take off the heat
        and toss the potatoes through the butter sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line two baking trays with baking paper and evenly distribute the
        potatoes across them, leaving lots of space around each potato. Using a
        glass or potato masher, press down onto the potatoes while still keeping
        them intact. Depending on your preference, you can smash them quite thin
        which will give you a crisper potato or smash them only slightly that
        will result in a fluffier inside. Both are delicious!
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle the potatoes with the remaining butter sauce and bake for 40
        minutes at 200 degrees celsius.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with some flakey sea salt and finely chopped parsley and serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
